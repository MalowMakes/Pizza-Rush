# PIZZA RUSH
Pizza Rush is a 2.5D platformer that sees the player take control of a pizza chef, who is tasked with traversing across an increasingly dangerous city to make a pizza delivery. The player must use a variety of movement techniques and move quickly to achieve the best grade possible.

## This Repository Explained
Pizza Rush is created using Unreal Engine 5 Blueprint. This means the game's logic is not coded in a traditional coding language, so many of these files (.uasset files) will be difficult to view without the use of UE5.
